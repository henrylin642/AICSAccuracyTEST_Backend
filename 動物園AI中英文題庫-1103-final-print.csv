I wonder if it escaped from the zoo's exhibit area?,- African Animal Area 👉 [Navigate here](https://zooguide.gov.taipei/home/map?poi_id=208&lang=en),
102,,,動物面,請問白鼻心的習性為何?,白鼻心又叫果子狸，雜食性，但對果實更為偏愛。牠們很會爬樹，近年因大眾對於環境保護、尊重生命以及與野生動物共存的意識提升，有部分野生動物開始回到本來的棲息環境，或是因為族群數量上升因此民眾有更多機會看見或與牠們活動範圍重疊，白鼻心即是近年最明顯的例子。,What are the habits of the Formosan Gem-faced Civet?,- Temperate Zone 👉 [Navigate here](https://zooguide.gov.taipei/home/map?poi_id=209&lang=en),

104,,,遊客詢問,動物園以前的活動有贈送印有動物圖樣的口罩，請問是否有直接購買的管道?,動物園的口罩僅提供在園內辦理研習營或教育活動時贈與民眾互動的文宣品，因此口罩只送不賣，因販售醫用口罩須持有販賣業藥商許可執照，本園並無藥商資格，不得販售醫用口罩，否則會違反藥事法相關規定。歡迎您來參加本園辦理的相關活動，就有機會獲得可愛動物圖型的口罩！,The zoo previously gave away masks printed with animal designs during past events. Is there a way to purchase them directly?,"Sorry, the zoo’s animal-design masks are giveaway publicity items for on-site camps and educational activities only and are not for sale. Selling medical masks requires a pharmacy sales license, which the zoo does not hold. You may receive one by joining related zoo activities.",
105,,,動物面,請問動物園繁殖的石虎會進行野放嗎?,動物園的石虎繁殖是國內石虎整體保育計畫中的一環，石虎的未來是否留在動物園內擔任保育大使，還是回到野外棲地去與其他野生石虎繁衍下一代，將會由國內各單位的石虎保育專家們開會討論，找出對牠與對臺灣的石虎族群最有利的去處。野外的石虎正面臨的各種危機則需要其他的處理對策，您的關心將會是改善我們臺灣石虎未來的最有力的後盾。,Will the Leopard Cat bred in zoos be released into the wild?,"Leopard Cat breeding at the zoo is part of a broader national conservation program. Whether an individual stays as an ambassador or is released to the wild is decided by Taiwan’s Leopard Cat conservation experts, choosing what best benefits the animal and the wild population. Wild threats require separate actions from release efforts.",
106,,,動物面,為什麼動物園的穿山甲都在洞裡面？,穿山甲是夜行性動物，牠的自然習性一天睡眠時間長達16小時以上，考量本園展示動物原則，尊重動物天性並讓動物有選擇權，並不會過度干涉動物行為，然仍有考慮到遊客服務教育的需要，因此本園所設計的穿山甲仿洞即是希望藉由玻璃觀察窗展現動物自然行為，此外一天中亦安排有兩次的餵飼時間，遊客也有機會看到動物起身活動的狀態，以尊重動物需求為前提之下亦盡量提升可見度，以平衡動物需要及遊客需求。,Why are all the pangolins in the zoo in caves?,"Pangolins are nocturnal burrowers that sleep 16+ hours a day. The zoo designs “artificial burrows” to respect their natural need to hide and choose when to be visible. Viewing windows let visitors observe natural behaviors, and there are about two feeding sessions daily to increase chances of seeing them—balancing animal welfare and education. (Source: Taipei Zoo)",
107,,,動物面,為什麼石虎與雲豹在展場常常看不見？,石虎及雲豹屬於個性機敏的中小型貓科動物，其天性喜歡躲藏在隱密處或高處觀察外界動靜，此外又因為牠們是夜行性動物，因此在接近下午後半時段，相較於其他時段較有機會看到動物活動。本園亦會本於尊重動物需求為前提之下，持續思考展場的設計，以盡量提升動物可見度。,Why are  Leopard Cat  and Clouded Leopard often not seen in exhibitions?,"Leopard Cats and Clouded Leopards are shy, mostly nocturnal cats. They rest by day, often hiding in secluded spots or high perches to watch quietly. Their camouflage patterns help them blend in, making them hard to spot. Activity increases from late afternoon into night, so that’s when you’re likelier to see them. The zoo designs exhibits to respect these needs while improving visibility. (Source: Taipei Zoo)",
108,,,動物面,臺灣黑熊站立時，是代表什麼情緒？ ,各種動物有屬於自己的行為樣態，黑熊站立通常是為了威嚇其他個體或是站高方便觀察等。,"What does it mean when a Asian Black Bear stands upright?
","When a Asian Black Bear stands upright, it’s usually to:
- Intimidate or warn others (a threat display).
- Get a better view or sniff to assess surroundings.

109,,,動物面,遊客模仿飼養員叫聲及模仿動作是否會影響黑熊？,基於動物福祉考量，園區各展示場(館)周邊皆設置提醒告示與服務中心進行不定時播音宣導，以提醒遊客避免不當行為，本園仍會加強人員巡查勸阻與播音宣導頻率，期提醒遊客配合遵守園區規定，共同維護動物健康和園區參觀環境。,"Will imitating the keeper’s calls or actions affect the Asian Black Bears?

111,,,動物面,最多造成這些野生動物受傷的前三個原因是什麼？,造成這些野生動物受傷的主要原因，前三名分別為：穿山甲遭犬隻攻擊、鳥類因撞擊玻璃（窗殺）受傷，以及各類動物因車輛撞擊（路殺）所致。,What are the top three causes of injuries to wild animals?,"The top three causes are:
- Dog attacks (especially on pangolins)
- Bird-window collisions (“window strikes”)
- Vehicle collisions (“roadkill”)

112,,,動物面,請問穿山甲有手嗎？,穿山甲為四肢著地行走的哺乳動物，牠們的前肢上有五指，並且指端長著強而有力的爪子，用於挖掘和攀爬。牠們的前肢主要用於工作和生存需要，不像人類的手那樣可用於精細的操作，我們通常稱為前肢而不會稱為手。,Does a pangolin have hands?,"Pangolins don’t have “hands” like humans. They are four-legged mammals with short forelimbs, each having five digits ending in strong claws. The forelimbs are specialized for digging burrows and tearing into ant and termite nests, not for fine manipulation—so we call them forelimbs rather than hands. (Source: Taipei Zoo animal guide)",
113,,,動物面,在山區附近發現有穿山甲住在洞穴內，因為擔心牠有危險，請問動物園可以把牠帶回園區認養嗎？,由於穿山甲為保育類動物，基本上不可去騷擾、捕抓牠們，如果您對該動物的安全性與存活有疑慮，請洽當地的野生動物主管單位(一般會是當地縣市政府的動保處)，由該單位評估是否需要進行移地保護、救傷收容或是不予以干擾。若經主管單位評估該個體有圈養保護的需要，將會詢問包括本園在內的各個野生動物救傷收容單位執行照養任務。,A pangolin has been found living in a burrow near a mountain area. I’m worried it might be in danger — can the zoo take it back and care for it?,"Thank you for caring. Pangolins are protected wildlife, so please do not disturb or capture it. If you’re concerned about its safety, contact your local government’s wildlife authority/animal protection office. They will assess whether rescue, relocation, or no intervention is appropriate. If captive care is needed, they will coordinate with authorized wildlife rescue centers (which may include our zoo). (Source: Taipei Zoo)",
114,,,動物面,請問熱帶雨林館（即穿山甲館）內青鸞等大鳥可以承受遊客超近距離的抗壓力嗎?,本園穿山甲館採沉浸式展示手法，讓民眾和動物都能自然融入環境中，除了在參觀步道周圍設置標語，提醒勿觸摸餵食動物外，也會有工作人員不定時巡邏，但更重要的是，遊客尊重和愛護動物的意識也必須提升！,Can large birds such as the Crested Argus inside the Tropical Rainforest House (also known as the Pangolin House) tolerate close proximity to visitors without stress?,"The Pangolin House uses immersive design so people and animals share the space calmly. We post “do not touch/feed” signs and staff patrol intermittently, but the key is visitor behavior: keeping respectful distance, staying quiet, and not reaching toward birds. With these measures, birds like the Crested Argus can remain comfortable. Please help by observing gently. (Source: Taipei Zoo)",
115,,,動物面,保育廊道內有貓頭鷹及穿山甲住在一起這樣可以嗎?,該場地為穿山甲及領角鴞的混種展示空間，兩種動物可以同住在一起，領角鴞主要住在高處，穿山甲是利用地面活動，混種展示可以讓場地充分被動物利用，也是國際上慣常用的展示手法。,Is it acceptable for owls and pangolins to live together in the Conservation Corridor?,"Yes. That space is a mixed-species exhibit for pangolins and collared scops owls. Owls mainly use high perches, while pangolins stay on the ground, so they can share the habitat. Mixed exhibits help animals use the whole space and are a common international practice. (Source: Taipei Zoo)",

127,,,動物面,請問臺灣黑熊會不會跟人一樣也怕太熱?,是的。在夏季高溫期間黑熊可能會出現呼吸急促情形，園方會持續關注動物的行為表現及狀況，適時調整照護方式。,"Do Asian Black Bears also get uncomfortable or afraid of the heat, just like humans do?
","Yes. In hot summer weather, Asian Black Bears may show rapid breathing. The zoo monitors their behavior and adjusts care as needed to keep them comfortable.",
128,,,動物面,請問天氣太熱時黑熊展場會如何處理?,黑熊展示場設有洞型遮蔭空間、水池，並搭配灑水系統，保育員不定期提供冰品，協助動物於夏季進行體溫調節。也會增加電解質水或冰並調高提供頻率，在必要時也會開啟室內欄舍，讓動物可自主選擇至較涼爽處休息。,What measures does the zoo take for the Asian Black Bear exhibit when the weather is too hot?,"When it’s very hot, the Asian Black Bear exhibit uses:

Shaded cave-like shelters and a pool
Misting/sprinkler systems
Ice treats provided by keepers
Increased electrolyte water/ice and frequency
Access to indoor holding areas so bears can choose cooler spaces
(Source: Taipei Zoo)",
129,,,動物面,請問在園內展場外面看到的野生獼猴、山羌、白鼻心等動物，是園內脫逃或飼養的嗎?,這些動物並不是園內脫逃或飼養的。因為本園坐落於淺山環境，臺灣獼猴、山羌、白鼻心、藍腹鷴目擊率相對較高，近年於社區目擊率也逐漸提升。,"When I see wild animals such as Formosan Rock Macaque, Formosan Reeve's Muntjac, or Formosan Gem-faced Civet outside the zoo exhibits, are they escaped or zoo-kept animals?","They are not escapees or zoo-kept animals. The zoo sits in a low-mountain area, so wild Formosan Rock Macaques, Formosan Reeve’s Muntjacs, Formosan Gem-faced Civets, and even Swinhoe’s pheasants are commonly seen nearby. Sightings in nearby communities have also increased in recent years.",
130,推廣組,學名斜體字,動物面,請問園內展示的雲豹是真正臺灣的雲豹嗎?,全世界的雲豹分為亞洲雲豹及巽他雲豹。 臺灣動物區的雲豹是亞洲雲豹，與臺灣原生的雲豹為同一種，是為本園參與歐洲暨水族協會的雲豹瀕危物種計畫而來到臺灣，並不是臺灣的雲豹。,Is the Clouded Leopard on display in the zoo a true Formosan Clouded Leopard?,"
Short answer: No.

The Clouded Leopard you see at the Taiwan Animals Area is the Asian Clouded Leopard . It is the same species as the former Formosan Clouded Leopard, but not the extinct Taiwan subspecies. It came to the zoo via the EAZA  Clouded Leopard program. (Source: Taipei Zoo animal guide and exhibit panels)",
131,動物組,黑熊在野外的活動範圍每年可達數百平方公里，但在圈養空間有活動空間受限，若缺乏足夠展現自然行為的機會，就可能因無聊、壓力或行為需求無法滿足而產生刻板行為，如反覆踱步、搖晃等。為了改善這種情況，動物園會實施環境豐富化措施，例如增加垂直空間利用、設置攀爬結構、藏食物、提供互動設施與動物訓練以降低異常行為發生。,動物面,動物園飼養的黑熊容易產生刻板行為嗎？,黑熊在野外的活動範圍每年可達數百平方公里，但在圈養空間有活動空間受限，若缺乏足夠展現自然行為的機會，就可能因無聊、壓力或行為需求無法滿足而產生刻板行為，如反覆踱步、搖晃等。為了改善這種情況，動物園會實施環境豐富化措施，例如增加垂直空間利用、設置攀爬結構、藏食物、提供互動設施與動物訓練以降低異常行為發生。,Are black bears in zoos prone to developing stereotypical behaviors?,"Black bears in the wild can roam hundreds of square kilometers annually, but their movement is restricted in captive enclosures. Without sufficient opportunities to exhibit natural behaviors, they may develop stereotypical behaviors such as pacing or rocking due to boredom, stress, or unmet behavioral needs. To mitigate this, zoos implement environmental enrichment measures. These include increasing vertical space utilization, installing climbing structures, hiding food, providing interactive facilities, and training animals to reduce the occurrence of abnormal behaviors.",
132,,,動物面,如何降低黑熊產生刻板行為？,本園盡力為動物提升福祉，因此保育員會利用場地高低落差設置了諸多動物行為豐富化設施，除透過食物（以日糧20%的比例更換當季蔬果）多樣性豐富黑熊日常生活外，每日提供豐富化玩具給黑熊使用；此外也導入動物正向訓練，幫助及陪伴動物儘可能降低異常行為，提升動物福祉。,How can stereotypic behaviors in Black Bears be reduced?,"To reduce stereotypic behaviors, the zoo focuses on welfare and enrichment:
- Environmental enrichment using height/terrain features, climbing structures, shade
- Diet variety: about 20% of the daily ration swapped for seasonal fruits/veggies
- Daily enrichment toys and foraging opportunities (e.g., hidden food)
- Positive reinforcement training to support natural behaviors and reduce stress
- Ongoing behavioral observation and adjusting the exhibit as needed

133,,,動物面,為什麼黑熊會一直反覆走來走去，牠是得了憂鬱症嗎?,針對此行為表現，園方將安排進一步行為觀察與評估以掌握動物當下的狀態與需求。保育員會透過持續於展場中調整設施配置，提供藏食、攀爬與遮蔽等提供多樣化體驗降低動物異常行為的產生。,"Why does the Asian Black Bear keep pacing back and forth? Is it suffering from depression?
","Pacing alone doesn’t mean “depression.” Bears may show repetitive pacing for several reasons (stress, anticipation, lack of stimulation). The zoo will:
- Conduct behavioral observation and assessment to understand current needs
- Adjust the exhibit setup (hiding spots, climbing, shade) and add foraging/enrichment
- Provide varied foods and daily enrichment toys
These steps help lower abnormal behaviors and improve welfare. (Source: Taipei Zoo)",
134,,,動物面,為什麼在穿山甲展示場會看到領角鴞呢？,保育廊道穿山甲展示場有與領角鴞混展，領角鴞主要住在高處，穿山甲利用地面，混種展示讓場地充分被動物所利用，也是國際上慣常用的展示手法。,Why can I see a Collared Scops Owl in the pangolin exhibit?,"Because it’s a mixed-species exhibit. In the pangolin area, Collared Scops Owls share the space: owls mainly use higher perches, while pangolins use the ground. This lets both species use different “layers” of the habitat—an approach commonly used in modern zoos. (Source: Taipei Zoo)",
135,,,動物面,臺灣獼猴身上有些光禿禿的地方是在脫毛嗎？還是皮膚病?,部分臺灣獼猴生活在大群體中，對於年紀稍長的個體，因群體日常互動理毛加上年紀大的關係，缺少毛髮的部分較不易完全復原。部分脫毛的原因主要是群體互動及賀爾蒙分泌異常所造成，並非黴菌感染或其他皮膚疾病。,"Are the bald patches on the Formosan Rock Macaque due to shedding, or are they caused by a skin disease?","They’re usually not a skin disease. In Formosan Rock Macaque that live in large groups, older individuals may show bald patches that don’t fully grow back due to frequent social grooming and age. Partial hair loss can also relate to social interactions and hormonal imbalance, not fungal infection or other skin disease. (Source: Taipei Zoo)",

137,,,動物面,請問動物園如何決定放展的動物呢? ,本園會依照每隻個體的健康狀況、行為表現及展示需求進行彈性調整與輪替，所有調度皆以動物福祉與個體需求為優先考量，亦同步評估整體教育展示與保育推廣目標的呈現。,How does the zoo decide which animals to include in its exhibits?,"We flexibly adjust and rotate animals based on each individual’s health, behavior, and display needs. All decisions prioritize animal welfare and individual requirements, while also considering education goals and conservation outreach objectives.",
